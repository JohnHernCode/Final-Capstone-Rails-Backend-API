Open Postman

- key: password value: admin 

Then go to 
- ```http://127.0.0.1:3000/login```
- Be sure that your parameter is POST and click Send

Once complete you will be able to copy your token.
- Click on the Authorization tab and select Bearer token.
- Be sure to paste your token if it is not already there.

Auto login happens after you have the auth token copied. Go to 
- ```http://127.0.0.1:3000/auto_login```
- Be sure that your parameter is POST and click Send
- It should auto log you in.

Retrieve all subjects
- Using GET as a parameter, go to
- ```http://127.0.0.1:3000/subjects```
- This will return all subjects.

Retrieve individual subjects 
- Using GET as a parameter, go to
- ```http://127.0.0.1:3000/subjects/1```
- Note the number, if you change it, you will see a different subject.
- This will return subjects only belonging to the user
